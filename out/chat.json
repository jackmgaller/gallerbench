We now have a starting letter R, an I that is somewhere (but not position 2), and an A that’s somewhere (but not positions 3 or 4).\n\nA good strategy is to try a guess that places A and I into new positions and tests new letters. I propose “RADIO.”\n\nLet’s check “RADIO” against our constraints:\n • R is at position 1 (required and green from “RIVAL”).\n • A is at position 2, which is allowed (we only know A cannot be in positions 3 or 4).\n • D is a new letter.\n • I is at position 4; since “RIVAL” told us I is not in position 2, position 4 is acceptable.\n • O is a new letter.\n\nThus, “RADIO” is a strong next guess.",
