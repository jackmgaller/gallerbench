Since we know 'H' is in the word but we've eliminated all positions except position 4, I must have made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe word has format C_A__ with 'H' somewhere. Since 'H' can't be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (as we've tried), it seems the only explanation is that there might be multiple 'H's in the word.\n\nLet me try:\n\nMy fifth guess is: CHASH\n\nThis keeps 'C' and 'A' in their correct positions, puts 'H' in position 2 again (to confirm my reasoning) and also in position 5, with 'S' in position 4 (though we know 'S' isn't in the word from our first guess)."

Now we have a clear picture!\n\nThe word format is C_A_H, where:\n- Letters S, T, R, E, I, N, M, P, L, K, H (in 2nd position) are not in the word\n\nFor my final guess, I'll try:\n\nMy sixth guess is: COACH\n\nThis fits all our known constraints: 'C' in position 1, 'A' in position 3, 'H' in position 5, and tries 'O' in position 2 and 'C' in position 4."
