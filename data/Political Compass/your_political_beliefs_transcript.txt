I'm very much a left-libertarian. Usually I'm for free market policies, but I still want a strong social safety net. I'd rather just give people a check though instead of like a bunch of disparate programs, and of course they can get more money if there are healthcare issues or they have dependents or etc.

I'm pro-choice, pro-gay, pro-trans. I think we should do something about climate change, but I'd rather have an economic solution than a legal one.
