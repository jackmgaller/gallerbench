Wordle: Version 1: You are playing Wordle. You will guess the word. For each
try, you propose a five letter English word to guess the target. Only common
English words are allowed. You cannot propose words that do not exist. You
cannot propose proper names. You cannot propose acronyms. You only have six
tries, so you must use your suggestions wisely to discern as many clues as
possible.\n\nYou must list out each of the green letters (the ones in the
correct position) before you make your next guess. What is your first guess?

My first guess is CRANE.

For guess "C R A N E" you got "Grey Green Grey Green Yellow"

This means that R and N are in the correct spots.

My next guess is DRONE

For guess "DRONE" you got "Yellow Green Grey Green Yellow".

I know that R and N are still in the right spots. Furthermore, D goes somewhere
else. I guess "TREND".

You Win! Great job!

Thanks!

Let's play again. What is your first guess?

    Version 1.1:

`Fixed a bug where AI didn't have access to its own messages.`

    Version 1.2

Added "in other words" to each response. Introduced the bigger word bank (3000
words)

    Version 1.3

Using the in-between word bank, old one had too many obscure words

    Version 1.4

Using a not 5 letter word is now a loss
